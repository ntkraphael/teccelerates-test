This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project is a test from Teccelerates requiring OpenID Connect (OIDC)single-logon to Azure Directory user account to fetch user data. The data is shown to a logged in page.

React framework Next.js version 14 is used in the project with next-auth for OIDC authentication

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or

```

Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
